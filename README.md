# EDA on SuperStore Data 

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial first step in the data analysis process. It involves the exploration, visualization, and understanding of the dataset to gain insights, identify patterns, and detect anomalies. In this case, we will perform EDA on the "SampleSuperstore" dataset to better understand the data related to a fictional superstore's sales and profits.

## Objectives 
1. To perform Exploratory Data Analysis
2. As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can work to make a profit

## Solution
I have loaded the dataset and cleaned (preprocess) it for consistency then moved to the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and the Data Visualization Part.
In EDA, I have compared the sales with the highest reason to the sales of the lowest region to find out the reason for low sales in the weaker areas and many more comparisons too I did to check out the weak areas and you can check in detail in my ipynb file.

## Conclusion
After fully exploring the data, I have suggested the following:
### Insights:-
-California and New York are far ahead of their competitor states in terms of profits.
-Discounts are triggering losses.
-The "Furniture" Category is the only loss-making sector that to only in the Central Region
-Losses are incurred in the Furniture Category irrespective of ship mode.
-Texas and Illinois are the only two states contributing to all the losses in the Furniture category in the Central Region
-Losses in Tables Sub Category are significantly high.
-Texas and Illinois are the only states providing discounts in the whole central region this justifies a high positive correlation between postal codes and discounts.
-Sales tend to go down when discounts go up in 3 out of 4 "Subcategories" and also in overall Furniture Category Sales in the Central Region.

## Recommendations 
-If we give more Discounts on products our sales increases but Profit goes down.
-In the Technology category business we get more Profit as compared to other two business. This is because we've given less Discount.
-Here we also focus on our Office Supplies category business because sales of these categories are less as compared to the other two.
-Also Sales in 'Fasteners', 'labels ' and 'Art' categories are so weak. so we have to concentrate on these sub-category businesses.
-We have to concentrate on the Sales of 'West Virginia State and 'San Luis Obispo' and 'Woodland' City.
-To raise the profits, we first need to sell consumer segment products.
-To enhance the profits, we need to sell more to the states which are liking our productsÂ¶ like NEWYORK and CALIFORNIA.
-Hence To get good profit in any business one should focus on increasing sales and not ignoring the discount factor as it plays an important role
